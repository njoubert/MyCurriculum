# My Curriculum

My Curriculum for Being a Lifetime Student

**Motivation**: My career will span the next 35 years. What skills will I need in 10 years? 20? 30? What skills will drive the world forward? And how will I learn them? By following My Curriculum, of coourse.

Focus on one or two things at once. (Two is good!). More than that, go in the back of the queue.

In general, take the course by the guy that wrote the textbook :)

# Technical
