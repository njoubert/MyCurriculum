# Curriculum

Personal Curriculum for the forseeable future. 

**Motivation**: My career will span the next 35 years. What skills will I need in 10 years? 20? 30? What skills will drive the world forward? And how will I learn them? By following the curriculum, of coourse.

Focus on one or two things at once. (Two is good!). The rest go into the queue.

In general, take the course by the guy that wrote the textbook :)

# Technical

## Signals and Systems esp. for Robotics (Estimation, Control, etc.)

### Mathematical Underpinnings

**Stanford CS205A Mathematical Models for Robotics, Vision and Graphics (Justin Solomon)**

Awesome course that covers all the fundamentals with good free online textbook. Math for CS folks. Linear Systems and Linearization, Eigenproblems and SVD, Unconstrained Optimization, Conjugate Gradiants, Interpolation, Integration and Differentiation, Ordinary Differential Equations. 

Perfected by [Justin Solomon](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon/), now professor at MIT.
